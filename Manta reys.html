<footer><h2>Life of manta rays</h2>

	<p>If one day you want me to tell you about the manta ray, be prepared for a stream of information that is hard to imagine. unfortunately, I can't load you with that much information, so I've summarized the main points.</p>
	
	<p>Manta rays are large, majestic marine creatures that belong to the family Mobulidae. They are closely related to sharks, and like sharks, they do not have bones in their bodies, but rather a flexible cartilage skeleton. Manta rays are found in tropical and subtropical waters all over the world, including in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans.</p>
	
	<p>The life of a manta ray typically begins when a female gives birth to a single pup. The gestation period can last up to 13 months, and once the pup is born, it will feed on its mother's milk until it is strong enough to hunt for itself. Manta rays are known to live for up to 50 years, and during that time, they will travel long distances in search of food and mating partners.</p>
	
	<p>Manta rays are gentle creatures and are not aggressive towards humans. They are, unfortunately, threatened by fishing and habitat destruction, which has led to declining populations in many areas. Conservation efforts are underway to protect manta rays, including the establishment of marine protected areas and sustainable fishing practices.</p>

	<p>They are one of the largest species of rays in the world. They can reach an average wingspan of 5-7 meters (16-23 feet), although some individuals have been recorded with wingspans of up to 9 meters (30 feet) across. The largest recorded manta ray had a wingspan of 9.1 meters (30 feet) and weighed 2,400 kilograms (5,280 pounds). Despite their large size, manta rays are graceful swimmers and can glide through the water with ease.</p>

	<p>Manta rays are filter feeders and primarily feed on plankton and small fish. They use their large, wide-open mouths to filter out tiny plankton and small fish from the water as they swim. Manta rays have a unique set of gill rakers, which are comb-like structures in their mouths that filter out food particles from the water. They consume large quantities of plankton-rich water as they swim, and their gill rakers filter out the plankton from the water before expelling it. Manta rays have been known to consume up to 13% of their body weight in plankton and small fish each week. Despite their size, manta rays have small teeth that are not used for feeding.</p>

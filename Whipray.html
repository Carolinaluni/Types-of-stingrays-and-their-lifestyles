	<p>The whipray, also known as the whiptail stingray, is a type of stingray that belongs to the family Dasyatidae. They are found in warm, shallow waters around the world, including the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>
	
	<p>The life of a whipray is similar to that of other stingrays. They are primarily bottom-dwelling fish that spend much of their time resting on the ocean floor. They have flattened bodies that are shaped like a diamond, with a long, slender tail that has a venomous spine at the base.</p>
	
	<p>Whiprays feed on a variety of small fish and invertebrates, which they capture by swooping down on them and engulfing them with their mouth. They also have a specialized electroreceptive system that allows them to detect the electrical impulses given off by their prey.</p>
	
	<p>Whiprays reproduce by laying eggs, which are protected by a leathery capsule that is anchored to the ocean floor. The eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adult ray, which are able to fend for themselves almost immediately.</p>

	<p>Despite being generally harmless to humans, whiprays are often caught by fishermen for their meat and their skin, which is used to make leather. They are also sometimes caught accidentally by trawlers and other fishing vessels, which can damage their delicate bodies and release them back into the water with injuries or infections.</p>

	<p>Whiprays can vary in size depending on the species. The smallest species of whipray, such as the long-tailed whipray (Himantura undulata), typically grow to about 1.5 to 2 feet (45 to 60 cm) in width, while the largest species, such as the giant whipray (Himantura chaophraya), can grow up to over 16 feet (5 meters) in width.</p>

    <p>Most species of whipray fall somewhere in between these two extremes, with an average width of around 3 to 4 feet (90 to 120 cm). It's worth noting that the size of a whipray can also depend on factors such as its age, sex, and diet. Males, for example, tend to be smaller than females in some species, while individuals that have access to more food may grow larger than those that are food-limited.</p>

<footer><h2>Life of smooth butterfly rays</h2>

	<p>The Smooth butterfly ray, also known as the Smooth butterfly skate, is a species of cartilaginous fish that is found in the coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina to Brazil. Here's a brief overview of its life:</p>
	
	<p>Reproduction: Smooth butterfly rays are oviparous, which means that they lay eggs. Females produce egg cases that contain one embryo each, and these egg cases are then attached to rocks or other hard substrates on the ocean floor. The eggs hatch after a period of several months, and the newborn rays emerge from the egg cases as fully-formed miniature versions of the adult ray.</p>
	
	<p>Diet: Smooth butterfly rays are bottom-feeders, and they primarily feed on small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. They use their flat, wide bodies and wing-like pectoral fins to glide over the ocean floor, and their long, pointed snouts to detect prey in the sand or mud.</p>
	
	<p>Behavior: Smooth butterfly rays are generally solitary creatures, and they spend most of their time resting on the ocean floor or swimming near the bottom in search of food. They are known to be relatively docile and non-aggressive, and they are sometimes kept in aquariums as display animals.</p>

	<p>Threats: Like many species of cartilaginous fish, Smooth butterfly rays are vulnerable to overfishing and habitat loss. They are sometimes caught accidentally in commercial fishing nets, and their numbers have declined in some areas as a result. Additionally, their eggs are often collected by humans for use in traditional medicines and aphrodisiacs, further threatening their populations.</p>

	<p>Conservation: Efforts are underway to protect Smooth butterfly rays and other cartilaginous fish species from overfishing and other threats. Some countries have implemented fishing quotas or bans on certain species, and there are also initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of commercial fishing on these animals. Conservation organizations are also working to raise awareness of the importance of these species and to promote sustainable fishing practices.</p>

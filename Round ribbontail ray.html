	<p>The round ribbontail ray, also known as the giant shovelnose ray, is a species of ray that is found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Western Atlantic, from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil. Here is an overview of the life of the round ribbontail ray:</p>
	
	<p>Physical Characteristics:
    The round ribbontail ray is a large and powerful ray, with a round disc-shaped body that can grow up to 2.4 meters in length and weigh over 150 kg. The body is covered with a sandpaper-like skin and has a distinctive diamond-shaped pattern on the upper side, with a brown or grey coloration. The round ribbontail ray also has a long, thin tail that has a distinctive ribbon-like appearance.</p>
	
	<p>Habitat and Behavior:
    The round ribbontail ray is a bottom-dwelling species that inhabits shallow sandy or muddy areas in coastal waters, estuaries, and bays. They are also known to enter freshwater environments such as rivers and lagoons. They are generally solitary animals, although they may form groups during mating season.</p>
	
	<p>Diet:
    The round ribbontail ray is a carnivorous species that feeds on a variety of small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks. They have a strong jaw and teeth that enable them to crush hard-shelled prey such as crabs and clams.</p>

	<p>Reproduction:
    The round ribbontail ray is oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young. Females typically lay a single egg capsule that contains a single embryo. The eggs are about 12 cm long and 5 cm wide and are deposited in sandy or muddy areas.</p>

	<p>Conservation Status:
    The round ribbontail ray is not currently considered to be a threatened species, although it is sometimes caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries. Like many species of rays, the round ribbontail ray is vulnerable to overfishing due to their slow reproductive rate, making conservation efforts important to maintain their populations.</p>

	<p>The porcupine ray, also known as the common stingray or bullseye ray, is a species of stingray found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Here is some information about its life:</p>
	
	<p>Physical characteristics:
    Porcupine rays have a distinctive appearance with a circular or diamond-shaped body that is brown or grey in color. The upper surface of their body is covered in small, spiky thorns, which give them the name "porcupine". They have a flattened head and a long, whip-like tail with a venomous spine at the base.</p>
	
	<p>Habitat:
    Porcupine rays prefer to live in shallow, coastal waters and are commonly found on sandy or muddy bottoms. They can also be found in rocky areas, seagrass beds, and estuaries.</p>
	
	<p>Behavior:
    Porcupine rays are typically solitary and nocturnal animals, meaning they are active at night. During the day, they hide in the sand or under rocks to avoid predators. They are carnivorous and feed on a variety of bottom-dwelling invertebrates such as crustaceans, mollusks, and worms.</p>

	<p>Reproduction:
    Porcupine rays have a slow reproductive rate, with females only giving birth to one or two pups every two years. The pups are born live and are completely independent at birth. The newborns measure around 20 cm in length and have a disc-like shape with short, stubby tails.</p>

	<p>Threats:
    Porcupine rays are often caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries, which is a major threat to their population. They are also vulnerable to habitat destruction and pollution, which can impact their food sources and reproductive success.</p>

    <p>Conservation status:
    The porcupine ray is currently classified as a species of "least concern" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, their population is declining in some areas, and efforts are being made to monitor and protect their habitat.</p>
